I will be executing the examples using various API's present in Apache Spark such as RDD's and DataFrames.\n\nThe notebook is written and executed on Databricks Community Edition. Getting started with Databricks community edition can be found <a href=\"https://docs.databricks.com/user-guide/index.html\">here</a>. Introduction to Apache Spark with Databricks can be found <a href=\"https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/training/index.html\">here</a>\n\nThis example has been insipred from <a href=\"https://www.mapr.com/blog/real-time-user-profiles-spark-drill-and-mapr-db\"> this blog post</a> on MapR Academy blog. The data has been acquired from the <a href=\"https://github.com/mapr/mapr-demos/tree/master/spark_music_demo\">Github account</a> of MapR academy.\n\n### Problem Statement\nIn a hypothetical music streaming website, customers are constantly connected to the service and are listening to the tracks. The data caputured by these events forms the core dataset of our problem. There are various attrubutes associated with the customers and the tracks. \n\n### Datasets\n\n1. <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mapr/mapr-demos/master/spark_music_demo/tracks.csv\"><b>tracks.csv</b></a> - Contains the collection of the data where the customer is listening to a track, one event per line. The various attributes present in the dataset are\n 1. Event ID : The unique identifier of the event where the customer is listening to the track (Integer)\n 2. Customer ID : The customer Id of the customer listening to the track (Integer)\n 3. Track ID : The track Id of the track currently being played (Integer)\n 4. DateTime : The date and tim, the customer is listening to the track (String)\n 5. Mobile : 1, if the customer is listening to the track on a mobile device else 0 (Integer)\n 6. Listening ZIP : The approximate Zip location of the customer listening to the track (Integer)\n2. <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mapr/mapr-demos/master/spark_music_demo/cust.csv\"> <b>cust.csv</b></a> - Contains the details about the customer\n 1. Customer ID: The unique identifier of the customer (Integer)\n 2. Name, Gender, Address, Zip : The information associated with the customer (String, Integer, String, Integer)\n 3. Sign Date : The date the customer has been added to the service (String)\n 4. Level : The level of subscription of the customer 0, 1, 2 for Free, Silver and Gold, respectively (Integer)\n 5.
